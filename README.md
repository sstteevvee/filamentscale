# filamentscale
Arduino project files for a 3D printed filament scale

Code is for [this project](https://www.printables.com/model/592091-filament-reel-holder-with-remaining-length-display) on printables.com. See the description there for more details.

This was made using vscode and platform.io, but it should work with minimal changes in Arduino IDE. Use the contents of "main.cpp" as your .ino file, and add a reference to the HX711 library.
