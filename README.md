# Introduction
This is an Arduino project for a [3D printed filament scale](https://www.printables.com/model/592091-filament-reel-holder-with-remaining-length-display) on printables.com. See the description there for more details.

This was made using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [platform.io](https://platformio.org/) plugin, but it should work with minimal changes in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

# Arduino IDE
Its been a while since I've used this. From memory you'll be able to use the contents of "main.cpp" as your .ino file, and add/import these libraries:
* bogde/HX711
* adafruit/Adafruit SSD1306
* adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library
